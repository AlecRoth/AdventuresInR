Hello!

This is a website started by Alec Roth in an attempt to document all the whizzing
and sparkly information and data based projects into one cohesive spot. My first
love for programming started in R, of all languages, so I will cover that mostly.

Learn more and contribute to my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlecRoth).
