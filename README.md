This is a static website for my website discussing statistics, study group progress, bloggings, and other adventures in my favorite language, R.

It is primarily based on the `blogdown` and `Hugo` frameworks; theme is Onwaru's [Newsroom](https://github.com/onweru/newsroom), hosted on Netlify as [AdventuresInR.com](AdventuresInR.com).

This repo is part professional portfolio for myself, part blog where I detail my progress through a multitude of courses, classes, and study groups.

Thanks for looking!
