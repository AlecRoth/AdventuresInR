# AdventuresInR
This is a static website for my website discussing statistics, study group
progress, bloggings, and other adventures in my favorite language, R.

Blogdown by Alec Roth

It is primarily based on the <blogdown> and <Hugo> framework, hosted on Netlify
as AdventuresInR.com 

This repo is part professional portfolio for myself, part blog where I detail 
my progress through a multitude of courses, classes, and study groups.

Thanks for looking!
